## GIT CODE ACADEMY LESSON
---
Git is a software that keeps track of changes made to a project over time. 

* git init
  * means _Initialize_

* Basic Git Workflow
  * _git init_ - Working Directory: makes changes to files: Additions, Deletions, Modifications
  * _git add_ - Staging area: files that are ready for commit
  * _git commit_ - Repository: Changes are saved to repository as a commit. 

* git status
  * To check the status of changed files. 

* git add
  * To start tracking on git, the file needs to be added to the staging area
  * Use git add _filename_
  * After adding the file, check the status. 

* git diff
  * Used to view the differences of a file within the working directory and the staging area. 
  * Use git diff _filename_

* git commit
  * Last step for a git workflow. It permanently stores changess from the staging area inside the repository. 
  * Use git commit -m "_comment_" 
  * Without the -m will open a text file where the comment will have to be placed. 

* git log
  * Allows you to refer to a previous version of the project. 
  * Use _git log_
